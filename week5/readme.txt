Main code for exercise 2 is in the ex2.sh and ex2norace.sh.
ex2start.sh and ex2startNoRace make new ex2test and ex2testNoRace files correspondingly and start execution of ex2.sh and ex2norace.sh correspondingly in background and foreground for given test files.
P.S. If start ex2start or ex2startNoRace result in the files will be the same because it makes new test files instead of edditing existing ones.

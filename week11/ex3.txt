As default buffering type is line buffering we can determine buffer before fork.
For 1(left) example such buffer is "Hello", while for 2(right) example buffer is empty, but "Hello\n" is already printed.

As fork just copy process, buffer will stay the same.
After invoking printf("/n") buffer with transition symbol will be printed in standart output.

As buffer of 1 example is "Hello" then "Hello\n" will be printed twice(1 from parent,1 from fork).
As buffer of 2 example is "" then "\n" will be printed twice.
